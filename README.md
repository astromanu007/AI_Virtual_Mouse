To run the Gesture Control Mouse program on a Redmi device, you'll need to follow these steps:

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt on your Redmi device and install the necessary Python libraries using pip. Run the following commands:
     ```
     pip install opencv-python-headless mediapipe pyautogui

     ```
     Replace `filename.py` with the actual name of the Python script you downloaded.

5. **Follow Gesture Instructions:**
